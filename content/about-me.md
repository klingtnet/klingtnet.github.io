# About Me

I am Andreas, a software developer with a [passion][rosc] [for][netdrop] [open][notes] [source][ssg], the web, and music of all kinds. Since 2017 I am getting paid to write reliable, efficient and easy to maintain software. My tools of choice are Linux, Go, Rust, Python and SQL[^1].

Sometimes I also do [illustrations](https://github.com/golang-leipzig/leipzig-gopher/blob/master/leipzig-gopher.svg), [exhibitions](https://github.com/klingtnet/KrachAdvent) or [weird noises](https://soundcloud.com/klingt-net/kuchenbreaks2).

[Leipzig, Germany][l] is my place of living, and where I am co-organizing the [local Go Meetup](https://golangleipzig.space).

[Drop me a mail](mailto:mail@andreas-linz.de) if you

- want to chat about some of the topics listed above, e.g. Go, audio programming, music etc.
- need advice or help with some programming problem.
- ~~want wo work with me.~~ Not for now, but if there's anything I can help you with then please contact me.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/klingtnet) and [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/u/klingtnet) :lobster:.
