Welcome. :wave: :slightly_smiling_face:

I am Andreas, a software developer from Leipzig, Germany.  If you want to know more about me then head over to the [about page](/about-me.html).

I own this domain since 2006 and the website served here [has seen many iterations](http://web.archive.org/web/*/klingt.net).
The domain name is a word play, `klingt.net` is pronounced "klingt nett" in german which translates to "sounds nice" in english.

This is my personal website and the articles reflect my own views and opinions, not those of my current or any former employer.

You cannot find me on social media, except you count GitHub as such.
