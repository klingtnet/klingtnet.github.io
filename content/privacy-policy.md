# Privacy Policy

I care about your privacy and this means that **I do not collect any personal data from you**.
    
Neither do I have any interest in doing so.  This website will not set any cookie, [it's just a bunch of static files served to you][repo] via [GitHub pages][gh-pages].

Personally I think It's a shame that many websites do the opposite and use [dark patterns][dp] to trick you into confirming to their data collection, e.g. by misleading cookie banner buttons.
