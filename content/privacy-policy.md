# Privacy Policy

I care about your privacy and this means that **I do not collect any personal data from you**.
    
Neither do I have any interest in doing so.  This website will not set any cookie, [it's just a bunch of static files served to you][repo] via [GitHub pages][gh-pages].

Personally I think It's a shame that many websites do the opposite and use [dark patterns][dp] to trick you into confirming to their data collection, e.g. by misleading cookie banner buttons.

Update 2022-01-23:

I decided to add [Nullitics], a privacy-friendly, cookie-less and GDPR compliant analytics system to the website.  The only insights I care about is which articles receive the most traffic.  Individual traffic is still something I do not care about.  My website works fine without Javascript, so if you are uncomfortable with Nullitics then please disable Javascript for this website.
