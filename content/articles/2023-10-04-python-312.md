# Yet another Python 3.12 release highlight summary

I'm doing a fair bit of Python lately, and thus need to stay up-to-date with the language releases.  Some days ago Python 3.12 was released.  The [release note overview](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/), and the detailed [release notes](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html) in particular, are worth a read.  Other articles I can recommend are [What didn't make the headlines](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/python-312-what-didnt-make-the-headlines) and [Static typing improvements](https://realpython.com/python312-typing/).

- [PEP-701](https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/) formalisation of f-strings will lift some limitations, like nested f-strings, use of the quotation delimiter of the f-strings inside an expression, comments in multi-line f-strings. Examples are listed in the PEP.

```python
>>> m = {'a': 'b'}
# This wasn't possible in prior versions.
>>> f'm={m['a']}'
'm=b'
```

Since Python3.8 there's also a debug format in f-strings, that is used when post-fixing a variable with `=`:

```python
>>> f'{m=}'
"m={'a': 'b'}"
# or as nested f-string
>>> f'Debug output {f'{m=}'}'
"Debug output m={'a': 'b'}"
```
- [PEP 688](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-688-making-the-buffer-protocol-accessible-in-python) exposes the _Buffer protocol_ (interface) to Python code.  This was limited to CPython before. I'm not sure what this is useful for.
- [PEP 669](https://peps.python.org/pep-0669/) introduces a new, low-overhead debugging and profiling API.
- [PEP 684](https://peps.python.org/pep-0684) adds support for isolated sub-interpreters with separate GILs, and is only available through the C-API. So, not of any particular use for me.
- [Improved error messages](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#improved-error-messages).
- Large and small [performance improvements](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#optimizations), enhanced [Linux `perf` support](https://docs.python.org/3.12/howto/perf_profiling.html).
- [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) adds a new type annotation syntax.

More compact way to create generic functions and classes:
```python
def max[T](args: Iterable[T]) -> T:
	...
```

Type aliases can be generic:

```python
type Point[T] = tuple[T, T]
```

- [PEP 698](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-698-override-decorator-for-static-typing) adds a `@override` decorator to indicate methods that should be overridden in a sub-class.
- The `sqlite3` module received a [command-line interface](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-cli).  This might be useful as a simple SQLite interface on systems that only have Python available.

```bash
# python -m sqlite3 [-h] [-v] [filename] [sql]
$ python -m sqlite3
sqlite3 shell, running on SQLite version 3.39.5
Connected to a transient in-memory database

Each command will be run using execute() on the cursor.
Type ".help" for more information; type ".quit" or CTRL-D to quit.
sqlite>
```

- The `uuid` package receive a [CLI](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/uuid.html#uuid-cli) as well. Now there's an easy cross-platform way to create UUIDs!

```python3
# python -m uuid [-h] [-u {uuid1,uuid3,uuid4,uuid5}] [-n NAMESPACE] [-N NAME]
$ python -m uuid -u uuid4
6ebeb0e2-6257-4eba-a638-97a20a222bed
```

- [`itertools.batched`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/itertools.html#itertools.batched) will be very useful for splitting workloads into evenly sized chunks.

```python
>>> from itertools import batched
>>> files = [f'{i}.txt' for i in range(1,11)]
>>> list(batched(files, 3))
[('1.txt', '2.txt', '3.txt'), ('4.txt', '5.txt', '6.txt'), ('7.txt', '8.txt', '9.txt'), ('10.txt',)]
```

- There's now `pathlib.Path` directory traversal function [`pathlib.Path.walk`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.walk).
- [`os.path.splitroot`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitroot) splits a path into a three tuple of `(drive, root, tail)` where `drive` is always empty on POSIX systems.

```python
# POSIX
>>> os.path.splitroot(os.getcwd())
('', '/', 'Users/someuser')
# Windows
('C:', '\\', 'Users\\someuser\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python312')
```
- [`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile) received a boolean `delete_on_close` argument, which should be self-explanatory.
- [`tempfile.mkdtemp`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkdtemp) always returns an absolute path now.
- Module `unittest` received a `--durations=N` flag to show the `N` slowest test cases.
- [Inlined return values can be accessed in a debugger session](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/python-312-what-didnt-make-the-headlines#%C2%A7a-better-debugging-experience), without adding a intermediate variable.

```python
# module.py
def g():
    return 21*2

def f():
    breakpoint()
    return g()

f()
```

Here's how to show the return value:

```
$ python -m module
> /private/var/folders/mc/3ssj7_c51dv76d6ll79s5l3w0000gn/T/tmp.xHdeQkAESD/module.py(6)f()
-> return g()
(Pdb) n
--Return--
> /private/var/folders/mc/3ssj7_c51dv76d6ll79s5l3w0000gn/T/tmp.xHdeQkAESD/module.py(6)f()->42
-> return g()
(Pdb) $_retval
42
(Pdb)
```
