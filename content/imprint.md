# Imprint

This is not a commercial website and thus does not need an [Imprint/Impressum](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/website-compliance-germany#impressum).  If there is something that I should take down or that may misrepresent you, please be a reasonable person, and just [send me an email](mailto:mail@andreas-linz.de) that explains what bothers you so that we can find an unbureaucratic solution.

I am also fine with receiving a "Thank you, I like what you do" :blush: .
